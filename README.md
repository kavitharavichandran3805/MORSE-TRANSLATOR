Real-Time Morse Code Translator using Eye Blinks

This project is an AI-powered real-time Morse code translator designed for people with disabilities, enabling communication using eye blinks. The system detects eye blinks, converts them into Morse code, and translates it into English text.

Features:
Eye Blink Detection: Uses computer vision to detect eye blinks.

Morse Code Conversion: Blinks are mapped to Morse code sequences.

Real-Time Translation: Converts Morse code into English text and speech.

User-Friendly Interface: A web-based UI for accessibility and ease of use.

Django REST Framework (DRF): Backend authentication and API handling.

This project aims to provide an alternative communication method for individuals with motor disabilities, ensuring ease of use across all age groups.
